This is for the Tableau/Citi bike module.

 I'll use this repo for my own records.

Overview:

The dynamic map visualization shows the popularity of bike end stations in New York City over time, with zip code data overlaid on the map. The visualization is based on data from the Citibike bike-sharing program for June 2013. The map allows us to see how the popularity of each station changes over the summer month, and to identify any trends in the data.

Trends:

One trend that is immediately noticeable is that the popularity of some stations varies from week-to-week. For example, the end station at West St & Chambers St in Lower Manhattan is consistently one of the most popular stations throughout the year, but its popularity drops significantly in the winter. Conversely, the end station at E 17 St & Broadway in Manhattan is relatively unpopular in the summer months, but becomes much more popular in the fall and winter.

Another trend is that certain areas of the city tend to have more popular end stations than others. For example, the end stations in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn tend to be more popular than those in other parts of the city. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the density of population or the availability of bike-friendly infrastructure.

Finally, it's worth noting that the overall popularity of the Citibike program appears to be relatively stable throughout the month, with minor fluctuations that would more-than-likely take the weather into consideration. This suggests that the program was able to maintain a steady level of usage during its 2013 June Summer month of operation, despite worldly factors.

Conclusion:

Overall, the dynamic map visualization provides a fascinating look at the popularity of bike end stations in New York City during June 2013 of the Citibike program. The visualization allows us to identify trends in the data that might not be immediately apparent from static visualizations or numerical summaries. This information could be useful for a variety of stakeholders, such as transportation planners or policymakers, who are interested in promoting bike-sharing programs or improving bike infrastructure in the city.
