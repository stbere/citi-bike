This is for the Tableau/Citi bike module.


■ The CV page is an introduction to the data story and provides an introductory with the author, me, Steve Reed.

■ The Age groups page shows that younger people have longer average trip durations, but older folks are more consistent in their usage. This could suggest that younger people are more likely to take leisurely rides, while older people may be more likely to use the bikes for commuting or errands.

■ The Birth year and age page shows that people aged 30-40 are the largest user group, and age 35 has the most users at 13K. This suggests that the bike sharing service is most popular among people in their thirties.

■ The Top 40+ popular stations page shows the top hourly duration and starting times, providing insights into when and where people are using Citibikes the most.

■ The Popular bike area of operation page shows a map with big circles indicating high usage. The fact that two of the most popular bikes have a small group of users could suggest that they are more reliable or well-maintained, or that the users who rent them are part of the community that shares the bikes.

■ The Basic static map page provides a map of all station locations, which can be useful for city officials to get an overall sense of where Citibike stations are located.

■ The Dynamic map page is a tool for city officials to explore the data in more detail. The tooltip information about station address, average trip duration in hours and minutes, average age of user, and gender of user provides insights into the demographics and behavior of Citibike users in different areas of the city.
